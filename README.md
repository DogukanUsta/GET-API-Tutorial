    Angular GET API Calls ...
In this project, I created a tutorial and development example for myself using the Angular GET API service. I used the Bootstrap library to enhance the organization, appearance, and design of my project. Using a popular weather example, I designed a card that displays a city's weather conditions and other related features such as humidity, feels like temperature, and pressure. In addition, I added a URL to the project that dynamically displays the weather condition as an icon when the city changes. To share this project with you, I am uploading it to my GitHub profile.
